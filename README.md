# django-hotjar
Hotjar is a new powerful tool that reveals the online behaviour and voice of your users. By combining both A) Analysis and B) Feedback tools, Hotjar gives you the ‘big picture’ of how to improve your site's user experience and performance (conversion rates).

The Analysis tools allow you to measure and observe user behaviour (what users do) while the Feedback tools allow you to hear what your users have to say (Voice of User / Customer).
